// 1. Added discount calculation
const discountType = quote.discountType || 'percentage';
const discountValue = quote.discountValue || 0;
let discountAmount = 0;
if (discountValue > 0) {
  if (discountType === 'percentage') {
    discountAmount = subtotal * (discountValue / 100);
  } else {
    discountAmount = discountValue;
  }
}

// 2. Updated VAT calculation to apply after discount
const vatAmount = (subtotal - discountAmount) * (vatRate / 100);
const total = subtotal - discountAmount + vatAmount;

// 3. Added discount row in totals table
${discountAmount > 0 ? `
<tr class="discount-row">
  <td>الخصم / Discount (${discountType === 'percentage' ? discountValue + '%' : 'Fixed'})</td>
