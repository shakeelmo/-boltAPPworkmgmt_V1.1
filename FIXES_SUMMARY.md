# SMART UNIVERSE Application - Issues Fixed ✅

## 🎯 All Previous Issues Successfully Resolved

### 1. **Logo Display Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: Logo was not displaying correctly despite multiple updates
- **Solution**: 
  - Created proper SVG logo file at `/public/logo.svg`
  - Updated `src/components/Layout/Header.tsx` to use `<img>` tag instead of background image
  - Updated `src/index.css` with proper styling for logo container and image
  - Logo now displays correctly in the top left corner

### 2. **Arabic Text Cutoff in PDFs** ✅
- **Problem**: Arabic text "الكون الذكي" was getting cut off at the top of PDF documents
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated CSS in `src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts` for `.company-name-ar` class
  - Adjusted font size, line height, and added word wrapping properties
  - Added proper RTL (right-to-left) text direction
  - Arabic text now displays properly without cutoff

### 3. **Delete/Edit PDF Functionality** ✅
- **Problem**: Users could not delete or edit PDF documents
- **Solution**: 
  - Confirmed delete and edit functions were already implemented in frontend (`QuoteCard.tsx`)
  - Updated `server/middleware/auth.js` to grant `delete` permission for `quotations` to `manager` role
  - Delete and edit functionality now works properly

### 4. **Database Schema Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: Multiple SQLite errors due to missing columns and incorrect schema
- **Solution**: 
  - Completely reset database and re-initialized with proper schema
  - Created and ran `server/migrate.js` to add all missing columns
  - Fixed `quotation_line_items` table with proper NOT NULL constraints
  - Added sample data for customers and vendors

### 5. **Authentication Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: bcrypt errors with undefined password fields
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed `server/routes/auth.js` to handle both `password` and `password_hash` fields
  - Created `server/createAdmin.js` to ensure proper admin user with hashed password
  - Authentication now works correctly

### 6. **API Query Errors** ✅
- **Problem**: SQL errors due to proposal references in quotations queries
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed all proposal references from `server/routes/quotations.js`
  - Updated SELECT queries to remove `p.title as proposal_title`
  - Updated INSERT statements to remove `proposal_id`
  - API queries now work without errors

### 7. **Foreign Key Constraint Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed when creating quotations
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `server/createSampleData.js` to add sample customers and vendors
  - Ensured all foreign key references have valid data
  - Quotation creation now works properly

### 8. **Line Items Schema Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: NOT NULL constraint errors for quotation line items
- **Solution**:
